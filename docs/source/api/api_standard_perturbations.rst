Perturbations
=============

Every time an instance of :class:`bayesbay.parameterization.Parameterization` or 
:class:`bayesbay.LogLikelihood` is initialized, functions defining possible model perturbations are generated under the hood using the classes listed below. For example, a uniformly-distributed free parameter is perturbed at a given Markov chain iteration through a function generated by the ``ParamPerturbation`` class. Changes in the dimensionality of a trans-dimensional parameterization are managed by ``BirthPerturbation`` and ``DeathPerturbation``. In hierarchical sampling, where the standard deviation of the data is treated as unknown, a perturbation function defined in ``NoisePerturbation`` is employed.
