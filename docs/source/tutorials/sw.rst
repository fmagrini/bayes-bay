Surface-Wave Dispersion Curves
------------------------------

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the application of BayesBay to a common problem in seismology: inferring the subsurface shear-velocity structure from observations of surface-wave group and phase velocities. Surface waves (Rayleigh and Love) are seismic waves that are generated by ambient noise or earthquakes and travel along the surface of our planet. They are routinely employed in the study of the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle.
