Surface-Wave Dispersion
-----------------------

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the application of BayesBay to a common problem in seismology: inferring the subsurface shear-velocity structure from observations of surface-wave group or phase velocity. 

Background
==========

Surface waves are seismic waves that are generated by both earthquakes and seismic ambient noise and travel along the surface of our planet. Two distinct types of surface waves are observed: *Rayleigh waves*, characterized by an elliptical particle motion in the vertical plane containing the direction of propagation, and *Love waves*, polarized horizontally and perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. When propagating in a vertically heterogeneous medium such as the Earth's interior, surface waves present dispersive properties. Since the depth sensitivity of a surface wave depends on its wavelenght, this means that different surface-wave frequencies travel at different speed, as they sample different depth ranges (and therefore elastic properties) within the Earth. 

This makes surface waves widely employed in the study of the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle, and suited
