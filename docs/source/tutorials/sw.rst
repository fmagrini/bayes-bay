Surface-Wave Dispersion
-----------------------

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the application of BayesBay to a common problem in seismology: inferring the subsurface shear-velocity structure from observations of surface-wave group or phase velocity. 

Background
==========

Surface waves are seismic waves generated by earthquakes and seismic ambient noise that travel along the surface of our planet. Two distinct types of surface waves are observed: *Rayleigh waves*, characterized by an elliptical particle motion in the vertical plane containing the direction of propagation, and *Love waves*, which are horizontally polarized and move perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

When propagating through a vertically heterogeneous medium like the solid Earth, surface waves exhibit dispersive properties. This means that different surface-wave frequencies travel at different speeds because they sample different depth ranges --- and thus different elastic properties --- of the Earth's interior. The frequency-dependent group or phase velocity of a surface wave, typically referred to as *dispersion curve*, varies as a function of subsusurface density (:math:`\rho`), shear velocity (:math:`V_S`), and compressional velocity (:math:`V_P`), with the sensitivity to :math:`V_S` being significantly larger compared to the other two. This makes surface waves widely employed in the tomographic imaging of the :math:`V_S` structure as a function of depth, at both crustal and lithospheric/upper-mantle scale. 

The problem of finding the subsurface model, :math:`\mathbf{m}`, that best explains an observed dispersion curve, :math:`\mathbf{d}_{obs}`, is inherently nonlinear and non-unique, meaning that distinct predictions :math:`\mathbf{d}_{pred} = g(\mathbf{m})` can similarly fit the observed data. Addressing this geophysical inverse problem typically requires discretizing the Earth's interior into a series of layers atop a homogeneous half-space, with each layer characterized by its thickness, :math:`V_S`, :math:`V_P`, and :math:`\rho`. In the following examples, this is achieved via the Voronoi tessellation provided by the :class:`bayesbay.discretization.Voronoi1D` class, allowing the number of stratified model layers to be treated as an unknown, to be inferred from the data.
